# Ideas

Add mass, momentum, and angular momentum.

Double size makes you 4x heavy.

Drunk mode only changes angular momentum, not orientation.

# States

Drunk Mode - Camera rotates in a wobble manner. Never over 30 degrees, and smoothly.

Fixed Mode - The camera gets "stuck" and fixed at the position when the mode started.

Tilted Mode - The camera bends downward and gives perspective to the scene.
